## **1. Iris Classification**

### **Overview**
This project involves classifying the Iris dataset using:
- TensorFlow Keras
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Lightning

### **Dataset**
The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) consists of 150 samples with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and three classes.

### **Models**
- **TensorFlow Keras**: A simple feed-forward neural network is implemented with three dense layers and softmax activation for output.
- **PyTorch**: The model is implemented using PyTorchâ€™s nn module, with training and validation loops manually coded.
- **PyTorch Lightning**: Uses the PyTorch Lightning framework for a structured training pipeline.

## **2. Handwriting Recognition**

### **Overview**
This project implements handwriting recognition on the MNIST dataset using:
- Dense Neural Networks (DNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### **Dataset**
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels) belonging to 10 classes (digits 0-9).

### **Models**
- **DNN**: Uses fully connected layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
- **CNN**: Incorporates convolutional and pooling layers to extract spatial features, followed by dense layers for classification.

### **Results**
The CNN model outperforms the DNN, achieving an accuracy of over 99% on the MNIST dataset.

## **3. CIFAR-10 Image Classification**

### **Overview**
This project leverages the VGG19 pre-trained model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### **Dataset**
The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) contains 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) in 10 classes, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

### **Model**
- **VGG19 Pre-trained Model**: The model uses ImageNet-pretrained weights for feature extraction, and custom dense layers are added for CIFAR-10 classification.

### **Results**
Achieves high accuracy (~90%) on the CIFAR-10 dataset with minimal training, thanks to transfer learning.
